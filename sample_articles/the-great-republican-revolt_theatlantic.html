They are <i>pissed off</i>. And when Donald Trump came along, they were the people who told the pollsters, “That’s my guy.”</p><p>They aren’t necessarily superconservative. They often don’t think in ideological terms at all. But they do strongly feel that life in this country used to be better for people like them—and they want that older country back.</p><p>You hear from people like them in many other democratic countries too. Across Europe, populist parties are delivering a message that combines defense of the welfare state with skepticism about immigration; that denounces the corruption of parliamentary democracy and also the risks of global capitalism. Some of these parties have a leftish flavor, like Italy’s Five Star Movement. Some are rooted to the right of center, like the U.K. Independence Party. Some descend from neofascists, like France’s National Front. Others trace their DNA to Communist parties, like Slovakia’s governing Direction–Social Democracy.</p><p>These populists seek to defend what the French call “acquired rights”—health care, pensions, and other programs that benefit older people—against bankers and technocrats who endlessly demand austerity; against migrants who make new claims and challenge accustomed ways; against a globalized market that depresses wages and benefits. In the United States, they lean Republican because they fear the Democrats want to take from them and redistribute to Americans who are newer, poorer, and in their view less deserving—to “spread the wealth around,” in candidate Barack Obama’s words to “Joe the Plumber” back in 2008. Yet they have come to fear more and more strongly that their party does not have their best interests at heart.</p><aside class="pullquote instapaper_ignore">Against all evidence, GOP donors interpreted the Tea Party as a movement in favor of the agenda of the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> editorial page.</aside><p>A majority of Republicans worry that corporations and the wealthy exert too much power. Their party leaders work to ensure that these same groups can exert even more. Mainstream Republicans were quite at ease with tax increases on households earning more than $250,000 in the aftermath of the Great Recession and the subsequent stimulus. Their congressional representatives had the opposite priorities. In 2008, many Republican primary voters had agreed with former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, who wanted “their next president to remind them of the guy they work with, not the guy who laid them off.” But those Republicans did not count for much once the primaries ended, and normal politics resumed between the multicultural Democrats and a plutocratic GOP.</p></section><div class="ad-boxinjector-wrapper"><gpt-ad id="boxinjector2" targeting-pos="boxinjector2" class="ad ad-boxinjector" lazy-load="2" data-object-pk="1" data-object-name="boxinjector"><gpt-sizeset viewport-size="[1050, 0]" sizes="[[728, 90], [728, 350], [970, 250], [1024, 350], [1, 3], [1600, 520], [1000, 350], [1600, 500], [970, 350]]"></gpt-sizeset><gpt-sizeset viewport-size="[1010, 0]" sizes="[[728, 90], [728, 350], [970, 250], [1, 3], [768, 350], [768, 520], [640, 360], [970, 350]]"></gpt-sizeset><gpt-sizeset viewport-size="[760, 0]" sizes="[[728, 90], [728, 350], [1, 3], [768, 350], [768, 520], [640, 360]]"></gpt-sizeset><gpt-sizeset viewport-size="[0, 0]" sizes="[[300, 250], [320, 350], [300, 350], [1, 3], [320, 520], [320, 430]]"></gpt-sizeset></gpt-ad></div><section id="article-section-3"><p>This year, they are counting for more.

In his famous book <i>Bowling Alone</i>, published in 2000, the social scientist Robert Putnam bemoaned the collapse in American political participation during the second half of the 20th century. Putnam suggested that this trend would continue as the World War II generation gave way to disengaged Gen Xers.</p><p>But even as Putnam’s book went into paperback, that notion was falling behind the times. In the 1996 presidential election, voter turnout had tumbled to the lowest level since the 1920s, less than 52 percent. Turnout rose slightly in November 2000. Then, suddenly: overdrive. In the presidential elections of 2004 and 2008, voter turnout spiked to levels not seen since before the voting age was lowered to 18, and in 2012 it dipped only a little. Voters were excited by a hailstorm of divisive events: the dot-com bust, the Bush-versus-Gore recount, the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the Iraq War, the financial crisis, the bailouts and stimulus, and the Affordable Care Act.</p><p>Putnam was right that Americans were turning away from traditional sources of information. But that was because they were turning to new ones: first cable news channels and partisan political documentaries; then blogs and news aggregators like the <i>Drudge Report</i> and <i>The Huffington Post</i>; after that, and most decisively, social media.</p><figure class="left" style="max-width: 253.0px;"><picture style="position:relative; width:100%; height:0; overflow:hidden; padding-bottom:133.201581028%;"><img alt="" data-src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2015/12/0116_Cover_RGB/20bfb476c.jpg" class="lazyload" style="position:absolute; width:100%; height:100%; top:0; left:0; border:0;"></picture></figure><p>Politics was becoming more central to Americans’ identities in the 21st century than it ever was in the 20th. Would you be upset if your child married a supporter of a different party from your own? In 1960, only 5 percent of Americans said yes. In 2010, a third of Democrats and half of Republicans did. Political identity has become so central because it has come to overlap with so many other aspects of identity: race, religion, lifestyle.

Since 1984, nearly every Democratic presidential-primary race has ended as a contest between a “wine track” candidate who appealed to professionals (Gary Hart, Michael Dukakis, Paul Tsongas, Bill Bradley, and Barack Obama) and a “beer track” candidate who mobilized the remains of the old industrial working class (Walter Mondale, Dick Gephardt, Bill Clinton, Al Gore, and Hillary Clinton). The Republicans have their equivalent in the battles between “Wall Street” and “Main Street” candidates. Until this decade, however, both parties—and especially the historically more cohesive Republicans—managed to keep sufficient class peace to preserve party unity.</p><p>Not anymore, at least not for the Republicans.</p><p>The Great Recession ended in the summer of 2009. Since then, the U.S. economy has been growing, but most incomes have not grown comparably. In 2014, real median household income remained almost $4,000 below the pre-recession level, and well below the level in 1999. The country has recovered from the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression. Most of its people have not. Many Republicans haven’t shared in the recovery and continued upward flight of their more affluent fellow partisans.</p><p>It was these pessimistic Republicans who powered the Tea Party movement of 2009 and 2010. They were not, as a rule, libertarians looking for an ultraminimal government. The closest study we have of the beliefs of Tea Party supporters, led by Theda Skocpol, a Harvard political scientist, found that “Tea Partiers judge entitlement programs not in terms of abstract free-market orthodoxy, but according to the <i>perceived deservingness of recipients</i>. The distinction between ‘workers’ and ‘people who don’t work’ is fundamental to Tea Party ideology.”</p></section><figure class="full-width" style="max-width: 960.0px;"><picture style="position:relative; width:100%; height:0; overflow:hidden; padding-bottom:150.0%;"><img alt="" data-src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2015/12/WEL_Frum_GOP_Rubio/31e91a0b0.jpg" class="lazyload" style="position:absolute; width:100%; height:100%; top:0; left:0; border:0;"></picture><figcaption class="caption">Marco Rubio at a town-hall meeting at the Wolfeboro Inn in Wolfeboro on October 7.

Or the commitment to ending health-insurance coverage for millions of working-age Americans. Or the anthems to wealth creation and entrepreneurship in a country increasingly skeptical of both.

A pro-immigration policy shift was one more assertion of class interest in a party program already brimful of them.</p><p>Nobody expressed the party elites’ consensus view more assuredly than Charles Krauthammer. “Ignore the trimmers,” he wrote in his first postelection column. “There’s no need for radical change. The other party thinks it owns the demographic future—counter that in one stroke by fixing the Latino problem. Do not, however, abandon the party’s philosophical anchor … No reinvention when none is needed.”</p><p>“We’ve gotta get rid of the immigration issue altogether,” Sean Hannity told his radio audience the day after the election. “It’s simple for me to fix it. I think you control the border first, you create a pathway for those people that are here, you don’t say, ‘You gotta go home.’ And that is a position that I’ve evolved on.”</p><p>A co-owner of Fox News—Krauthammer and Hannity’s TV network—agreed: “Must have sweeping, generous immigration reform,” tweeted Rupert Murdoch on November 7, 2012. “It would be inhumane to send those people back, to send 12 million people out of this country,” the casino mogul and Republican donor Sheldon Adelson told <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> in December of that year. “We’ve got to find a way, find a route, for those people to get legal citizenship.” The Republican National Committee made it all official in a March 2013 postelection report signed by party eminences. The report generally avoided policy recommendations, with a notable exception: “We must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform.” To advance the cause, Paul Singer, one of the most open-pocketed GOP donors, made a six-figure contribution to the National Immigration Forum that spring.</p></section><div class="ad-boxinjector-wrapper"><gpt-ad id="boxinjector6" targeting-pos="boxinjector6" class="ad ad-boxinjector" lazy-load="2" data-object-pk="1" data-object-name="boxinjector"><gpt-sizeset viewport-size="[1050, 0]" sizes="[[728, 90], [728, 350], [970, 250], [1024, 350], [1, 3], [1600, 520], [1000, 350], [1600, 500], [970, 350]]"></gpt-sizeset><gpt-sizeset viewport-size="[1010, 0]" sizes="[[728, 90], [728, 350], [970, 250], [1, 3], [768, 350], [768, 520], [640, 360], [970, 350]]"></gpt-sizeset><gpt-sizeset viewport-size="[760, 0]" sizes="[[728, 90], [728, 350], [1, 3], [768, 350], [768, 520], [640, 360]]"></gpt-sizeset><gpt-sizeset viewport-size="[0, 0]" sizes="[[300, 250], [320, 350], [300, 350], [1, 3], [320, 520], [320, 430]]"></gpt-sizeset></gpt-ad></div><section id="article-section-10"><p>If all of this sounds like a prescription for a Jeb Bush candidacy for president … well, perhaps that was not an entirely unintended consequence.</p><p>Almost as soon as the new Congress convened in 2013, Senate Republicans worked to strike a deal over immigration issues.

Bush’s tax cuts for high earners expired in 2013, and Republicans could not renew them. The drive to cut the deficit ended in budget sequestration, whose harshest effect fell on the military. The Gang of Eight deal never came to a vote in the House. All the while, Republicans’ approval ratings slipped and slid. Instead of holding on to their base and adding Hispanics, Republicans alienated their base in return for no gains at all. By mid-2015, a majority of self-identified Republicans disapproved of their party’s congressional leadership—an intensity of disapproval never seen by the Republican majority of the 1990s nor by Democrats during their time in the majority after the 2006 midterm elections.</p><p>In fact, disapproval had flared into an outright revolt of the Republican base in the summer of 2014. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, the No. 2 man in the Republican caucus, had emerged as a leader of the new line on immigration. Up for reelection in Virginia’s Seventh District, Cantor was challenged that year by a conservative Christian professor of economics, Dave Brat. During Obama’s first term, Tea Party insurgents had toppled incumbents and defeated party favorites in primaries from Delaware to Nevada. Those challenges had ended badly in the general election, for the most part: Tea Party Republicans lost at least five Senate seats that might plausibly have been won. Party leaders believed the lesson had been learned and expected their voters to be more tractable in future elections.</p></section><div class="ad-boxinjector-wrapper"><gpt-ad id="boxinjector7" targeting-pos="boxinjector7" class="ad ad-boxinjector" lazy-load="2" data-object-pk="1" data-object-name="boxinjector"><gpt-sizeset viewport-size="[1050, 0]" sizes="[[728, 90], [728, 350], [970, 250], [1024, 350], [1, 3], [1600, 520], [1000, 350], [1600, 500], [970, 350]]"></gpt-sizeset><gpt-sizeset viewport-size="[1010, 0]" sizes="[[728, 90], [728, 350], [970, 250], [1, 3], [768, 350], [768, 520], [640, 360], [970, 350]]"></gpt-sizeset><gpt-sizeset viewport-size="[760, 0]" sizes="[[728, 90], [728, 350], [1, 3], [768, 350], [768, 520], [640, 360]]"></gpt-sizeset><gpt-sizeset viewport-size="[0, 0]" sizes="[[300, 250], [320, 350], [300, 350], [1, 3], [320, 520], [320, 430]]"></gpt-sizeset></gpt-ad></div><section id="article-section-11"><p>Cantor’s loss to Brat jolted House leaders.

They continued to fill the coffers of Jeb Bush and, to a lesser extent, Rubio and Scott Walker, all reliable purveyors of Conservatism Classic. Last February, three of the party’s most important moneymen—the fast-food executive Andrew Puzder, the health-care investor Mike Fernandez, and the national finance chair of Mitt Romney’s 2012 campaign, Spencer Zwick—publicly urged the GOP to push ahead toward more-open immigration. “America should be a destination for hardworking immigrants from all over the world,” said Puzder, an advocate of importing more low-skilled laborers to meet the needs of his high-turnover industry.

Carson appealed to the same religious conservatives that candidates like Mike Huckabee and Santorum had appealed to in prior presidential cycles. What was new and astonishing was the Trump boom. He jettisoned party orthodoxy on issues ranging from entitlement spending to foreign policy. He scoffed at trade agreements. He said rude things about Sheldon Adelson and the Koch brothers.

Sixty-six percent believed the president was a Muslim.</p><p>Trump promised to protect these voters’ pensions from their own party’s austerity. “We’ve got Social Security that’s going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesn’t bring money into the country. All these other people want to cut the hell out of it. I’m not going to cut it at all; I’m going to bring money in, and we’re going to save it.”</p><p>He promised to protect their children from being drawn into another war in the Middle East, this time in Syria. “If we’re going to have World War III,” he told <i>The Washington Post </i>in October, “it’s not going to be over Syria.” As for the politicians threatening to shoot down the Russian jets flying missions in Syria, “I won’t even call them hawks. I call them the fools.”</p></section><div class="ad-boxinjector-wrapper"><gpt-ad id="boxinjector10" targeting-pos="boxinjector10" class="ad ad-boxinjector" lazy-load="2" data-object-pk="1" data-object-name="boxinjector"><gpt-sizeset viewport-size="[1050, 0]" sizes="[[728, 90], [728, 350], [970, 250], [1024, 350], [1, 3], [1600, 520], [1000, 350], [1600, 500], [970, 350]]"></gpt-sizeset><gpt-sizeset viewport-size="[1010, 0]" sizes="[[728, 90], [728, 350], [970, 250], [1, 3], [768, 350], [768, 520], [640, 360], [970, 350]]"></gpt-sizeset><gpt-sizeset viewport-size="[760, 0]" sizes="[[728, 90], [728, 350], [1, 3], [768, 350], [768, 520], [640, 360]]"></gpt-sizeset><gpt-sizeset viewport-size="[0, 0]" sizes="[[300, 250], [320, 350], [300, 350], [1, 3], [320, 520], [320, 430]]"></gpt-sizeset></gpt-ad></div><section id="article-section-16"><p>He promised a campaign independent of the influences of money that had swayed so many Republican races of the past. “I will tell you that our system is broken.

He has thrown into disarray the party’s post-2012 comeback strategy, and pulled into the center of national discussion issues and constituencies long relegated to the margins.</p><p>Something has changed in American politics since the Great Recession. The old slogans ring hollow. The insurgent candidates are less absurd, the orthodox candidates more vulnerable. The GOP donor elite planned a dynastic restoration in 2016.

Bush’s team believed that the last-minute revelation of a 1976 drunk-driving arrest cost him the popular vote in the 2000 election. Jimmy Carter blamed his 1980 defeat on the debacle of the attempted rescue of American hostages in Iran. So anything can happen. But that does not mean anything <i>will</i> happen.

And what next after that? None of the options facing the GOP elite is entirely congenial. But there appear to be four paths the elite could follow, for this campaign season and beyond. They lead the party in very different directions.</p><h3><span class="caps">Option 1: Double Down</span></h3><p>The premise of the past few thousand words is that the Republican donor elite failed to impose its preferred candidate on an unwilling base in 2015 for big and important reasons. But maybe that premise is wrong. Maybe Jeb Bush has just been a bad candidate with a radioactive last name. Maybe the same message and platform would have worked fine if espoused by a fresher and livelier candidate. Such is the theory of Marco Rubio’s campaign. Or—even if the donor message and platform have troubles—maybe $100 million in negative ads can scorch any potential alternative, enabling the donor-backed candidate to win by default.</p><p>And if not Rubio, maybe the core donor message could still work if joined to a true outsider candidacy: Ben Carson’s, for example. Carson is often regarded as a protest candidate, but as <i>The Weekly Standard</i>’s Fred Barnes enthused back in January 2015: “One thing not in doubt is Carson’s conservatism. He’s the real deal, an economic, social, and foreign policy conservative.” Carson may say wacky things, but he does not say heterodox things.</p><p>Yet even if the Republican donor elite can keep control of the party while doubling down, it’s doubtful that the tactic can ultimately win presidential elections. The “change nothing but immigration” advice was a self-flattering fantasy from the start. Immigration is not the main reason Republican presidential candidates lose so badly among Latino and Asian American voters, and never was: Latino voters are more likely to list education and health care as issues that are extremely important to them. A majority of Asian Americans are non-Christian and susceptible to exclusion by sectarian religious themes.</p></section><div class="ad-boxinjector-wrapper"><gpt-ad id="boxinjector12" targeting-pos="boxinjector12" class="ad ad-boxinjector" lazy-load="2" data-object-pk="1" data-object-name="boxinjector"><gpt-sizeset viewport-size="[1050, 0]" sizes="[[728, 90], [728, 350], [970, 250], [1024, 350], [1, 3], [1600, 520], [1000, 350], [1600, 500], [970, 350]]"></gpt-sizeset><gpt-sizeset viewport-size="[1010, 0]" sizes="[[728, 90], [728, 350], [970, 250], [1, 3], [768, 350], [768, 520], [640, 360], [970, 350]]"></gpt-sizeset><gpt-sizeset viewport-size="[760, 0]" sizes="[[728, 90], [728, 350], [1, 3], [768, 350], [768, 520], [640, 360]]"></gpt-sizeset><gpt-sizeset viewport-size="[0, 0]" sizes="[[300, 250], [320, 350], [300, 350], [1, 3], [320, 520], [320, 430]]"></gpt-sizeset></gpt-ad></div><section id="article-section-19"><p>So …</p><h3>Option 2: Tactical Concession</h3><p>Perhaps some concession to the disgruntled base is needed. That’s the theory of the Cruz campaign and—after a course correction—also of the Christie campaign. Instead of 2013’s “Conservatism Classic Plus Immigration Liberalization,” Cruz and Christie are urging “Conservatism Classic Plus Immigration Enforcement.” True, Cruz’s carefully selected words on immigration leave open the possibility of guest-worker programs or other pro-employer reforms after a burst of border enforcement. But Cruz and Christie have seen the reaction to Donald Trump’s message, and appear to appreciate the need to at least seem to do something to redress the grievances of the Republican base.</p><p>Much of the donor elite could likely be convinced that while Jeb Bush’s idea of immigration reform would be good to have, it isn’t a must-have. Just as the party elite reached a pact on abortion with social conservatives in the 1980s, it could concede the immigration issue to its Main Street base in the 2010s.</p><aside class="pullquote instapaper_ignore">The party elites’ “change nothing but immigration” advice after Romney’s defeat was a self-flattering fantasy from the start.</aside><p>Yet a narrow focus on immigration populism alone seems insufficient to raise Republican hopes. Trump shrewdly joins his immigration populism to trade populism. On the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders’s opposition to open borders is logically connected to his hopes for a Democratic Socialist future: His admired Denmark upholds high labor standards along with some of the world’s toughest immigration rules. Severed from a larger agenda, however—as Mitt Romney tried to sever the issue in 2012—immigration populism looks at best like pandering, and at worst like identity politics for white voters. In a society that is and always has been multiethnic and polyglot, any national party must compete more broadly than that.</p><p>Which brings us to …</p><h3>Option 3: True Reform</h3><p>Admittedly, this may be the most uncongenial thought of them all, but party elites could try to open more ideological space for the economic interests of the middle class. Make peace with universal health-insurance coverage: Mend Obamacare rather than end it. Cut taxes less at the top, and use the money to deliver more benefits to working families in the middle. Devise immigration policy to support wages, not undercut them. Worry more about regulations that artificially transfer wealth upward, and less about regulations that constrain financial speculation. Take seriously issues such as the length of commutes, nursing-home costs, and the anticompetitive practices that inflate college tuition. Remember that Republican voters care more about aligning government with their values of work and family than they care about cutting the size of government as an end in itself. Recognize that the gimmick of mobilizing the base with culture-war outrages stopped working at least a decade ago.</p></section><figure class="full-width" style="max-width: 960.0px;"><picture style="position:relative; width:100%; height:0; overflow:hidden; padding-bottom:43.3333333333%;"><img alt="" data-src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2015/12/WEL_Frum_GOP_triptych/55837af8f.jpg" class="lazyload" style="position:absolute; width:100%; height:100%; top:0; left:0; border:0;"></picture><figcaption class="caption"><em>Left</em>: Rick Santorum at Murphy’s Diner in Manchester on July 25. <em>Center</em>: Lindsey Graham at the Milford Labor Day parade on September 7. <em>Right</em>: George Pataki at the Granite State Brewers Association Summerfest at Arms Park, in Manchester, on July 25.

True, center-right conservative parties backed by broad multiethnic coalitions of the middle class have gained and exercised power in other English-speaking countries, even as Republicans lost the presidency in 2008 and 2012. But the most-influential voices in American conservatism reject the experience of their foreign counterparts as weak, unprincipled, and unnecessary. In parliamentary democracy, winning or losing is starkly binary: A party either is in power or is the opposition. In the American system, that binary is much blurrier. Republicans can, of course, exert some control over government as long as they hold any one of the House, Senate, or presidency.</p><p>Which brings us finally to …</p><h3>Option 4: Change the Rules of the Game</h3><p>“The filibuster used to be bad. Now it’s good.” So Fred Thompson, the late actor and former Republican senator, jokingly told an audience on a <i>National Review</i> cruise shortly after Barack Obama won the presidency for the first time. How partisans feel about process issues is notoriously related to what process would benefit them at any given moment. Liberals loved the interventionist Supreme Court in the 1960s and ’70s, hated it in the 1990s and 2000s—and may rotate their opinion again if a President Hillary Clinton can tilt a majority of the Supreme Court their way. It’s an old story that may find a new twist if and when Republicans acknowledge that the presidency may be attainable only after they make policy changes that are unacceptable to the party elite.</p><p>There are metrics, after all, by which the post-2009 GOP appears to be a supremely successful political party. Recently, Rory Cooper, of the communications firm Purple Strategies, tallied a net gain to the Republicans of 69 seats in the House of Representatives, 13 seats in the Senate, 900-plus seats in state legislatures, and 12 governorships since Obama took office. With that kind of grip on state government, in particular, Republicans are well positioned to write election and voting rules that sustain their hold on the national legislature. The president may be able to grant formerly illegal immigrants the right to work, but he cannot grant them the right to vote. In this light, instead of revising Republican policies to stop future Barack Obamas and Hillary Clintons, maybe it’s necessary to revise only the party rules to stop future Donald Trumps from confronting party elites with their own unpopularity.</p></section><div class="ad-boxinjector-wrapper"><gpt-ad id="boxinjector14" targeting-pos="boxinjector14" class="ad ad-boxinjector" lazy-load="2" data-object-pk="1" data-object-name="boxinjector"><gpt-sizeset viewport-size="[1050, 0]" sizes="[[728, 90], [728, 350], [970, 250], [1024, 350], [1, 3], [1600, 520], [1000, 350], [1600, 500], [970, 350]]"></gpt-sizeset><gpt-sizeset viewport-size="[1010, 0]" sizes="[[728, 90], [728, 350], [970, 250], [1, 3], [768, 350], [768, 520], [640, 360], [970, 350]]"></gpt-sizeset><gpt-sizeset viewport-size="[760, 0]" sizes="[[728, 90], [728, 350], [1, 3], [768, 350], [768, 520], [640, 360]]"></gpt-sizeset><gpt-sizeset viewport-size="[0, 0]" sizes="[[300, 250], [320, 350], [300, 350], [1, 3], [320, 520], [320, 430]]"></gpt-sizeset></gpt-ad></div><!-- Read "Follow-up Notes" --><!-- END "Follow-up Notes" --><section id="article-section-22"><p>The inaugural issue of <i>The Weekly Standard</i>, the conservative magazine launched in 1995, depicted then–Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich swinging into action, a submachine gun blazing in his left hand, under the headline “Permanent Offense.” But that was then. Maybe the more natural condition of conservative parties is permanent defense—and where better to wage a long, grinding defensive campaign than in Congress and the statehouses? Maybe the presidency itself should be regarded as one of those things that is good to have but not a must-have, especially if obtaining it requires uncomfortable change.</p><aside class="callout callout-notes"><hr><h4>Read Follow-Up <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/notes/" data-omni-click="r'article',r'callout',r'0',r'419118'">Notes</a></h4>

Does it challenge itself to build a new political majority? Or does it seize the opportunities the American political system offers to compact and purposeful minorities? When its old answers fail, will it think anew? Or will it simply repeat louder the dogmas that enthralled supporters in the past?

But the answer to one question was astonishing. The Fed asked respondents how they would pay for a $400 emergency. The answer: <i>47 percent</i> of respondents said that either they would cover the expense by borrowing or selling something, or they would not be able to come up with the $400 at all. <i>Four hundred dollars!</i> Who knew?</p>&#13;

        <p class="dek">A recently published paper explains how &ldquo;concept creep&rdquo; in the field of psychology has reshaped many aspects of modern society.</p>
        
        <div class="excerpt">
            <p>A mother leaves her son in the car while popping into a store at a strip mall. She <a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/06/03/the_day_i_left_my_son_in_the_car/">is charged</a> with contributing to the delinquency of a minor. A high school senior complains to her Facebook friends about a teacher <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/08/us/08cyberbully.html?_r=1">and is suspended</a> for &#x201C;cyberbullying.&#x201D; Students at Wellesley <a href="https://www.change.org/p/president-h-kim-bottomly-move-the-sleepwalker-inside-the-davis-museum">start a petition</a> calling for the removal of a statue of a man in his underwear, claiming that the art piece caused them emotional trauma. So many residents of Santa Monica, California, claim to need emotional support animals that the local farmer&#x2019;s market warns against service dog fraud.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>How did American culture arrive at these moments? A new research paper by Nick Haslam, a professor of psychology at the University of Melbourne, Australia, offers as useful a framework for understanding what&#x2019;s going on as any I&#x2019;ve seen. In &#x201C;<a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1047840X.2016.1082418">Concept Creep: Psychology's Expanding Concepts of Harm and Pathology</a>,&#x201D; Haslam argues that concepts like abuse, bullying, trauma, mental disorder, addiction, and prejudice, &#x201C;now encompass a much broader range of phenomena than before,&#x201D;expanded meanings that reflect &#x201C;an ever-increasing sensitivity to harm.&#x201D;</p>&#13;

        <p class="dek">Forget media archetypes of older Millennials as college-educated singles living in cities. The typical 29-year-old is living with a partner in the suburbs&mdash;without a bachelor&rsquo;s degree.</p>
        
        <div class="excerpt">
            <p dir="ltr">What is the typical life experience for an American on the verge of turning 30?</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr">This is a hard question to answer, no matter who is asking. But it&#x2019;s become especially difficult for an industry responsible with providing the answers: the national press. An irony of digital media is that the Internet distributes journalism, but it concentrates journalists. Jobs at media sites like <em>The Atlantic</em>, <em>BuzzFeed</em>, or <em>Gawker</em> are <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/03/the-game-of-concentration-the-internet-is-pushing-the-american-news-business-to-new-york-and-the-coasts/">five-times more likely</a> to be located in New York or Washington, D.C., than television-news jobs. The clustering force is only getting more centripetal: The share of reporting jobs in Los Angeles, NYC, and DC <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/03/the-game-of-concentration-the-internet-is-pushing-the-american-news-business-to-new-york-and-the-coasts/">increased by 60 percent between 2004 and 2014</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr">It&#x2019;s easy to imagine many downsides of this agglomeration, like the dissolution of local reporting, but a subtler risk is that well-educated journalists in these dense cities wind up with a skewed impression of the world, a <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03022">&#x201C;majority illusion</a>&#x201D; based on the extremely unrepresentative cross-section of the country that&#x2019;s immediately around them. To be fair, being a reporter in Des Moines or rural Nebraska, while it provides a better view of Des Moines and rural Nebraska, doesn&#x2019;t offer a universal window into the average experiences of all Americans, either. For that, one needs something else, like a national survey.</p>&#13;

            <p>Bipartisanship has become so rare in Washington that pundits risk forgetting how lousy it can be. In 1964, Democrats and Republicans <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0807.html">came together</a> to overwhelmingly pass the Tonkin Gulf Resolution, which authorized Lyndon Johnson to use force in Vietnam. The Defense of Marriage Act, which in 1996 made gay marriage illegal under federal law, <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/104-1996/h316">enjoyed</a> broad bipartisan support too.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>It&#x2019;s worth remembering this when reading <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/16/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-warns-ofeconomic-fallout-if-congress-passes-9-11-bill.html?_r=0--">about</a> the &#x201C;unlikely coalition of liberal and conservative senators&#x201D; including Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz (along with former Senator Hillary Clinton)&#x2014;that supports the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act. The legislation, which in January passed the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously, carves out an exception to a 1976 law that immunizes foreign governments from lawsuits in American courts. The exception would allow Americans injured in terrorist attacks on American soil to sue governments that support terrorism. What that really means, given that 15 of the 19 9/11 hijackers were Saudi, and some believe elements of the Saudi government aided the attack, is that victims of September 11 could sue Saudi Arabia.</p>&#13;

        <div class="excerpt">
            <p>A couple of weeks ago, I was talking with Philip Gordon, who held the Middle East portfolio at the National Security Council from 2013 to 2015 (and before that, served as assistant secretary of state for European affairs) about my Atlantic article, &#x201C;<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/04/the-obama-doctrine/471525/">The Obama Doctrine</a>.&#x201D; The piece tried to explain how the president understands the world, and America&#x2019;s role in it. (This week, the president is on a tour of the some of the countries he discussed in the article.)</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Gordon, a loyal Obama man, is, like his ex-boss, somewhat-to-very fatalistic about the ability of the U.S. to direct the course of events in the Middle East (&#x201C;realistic,&#x201D; rather than &#x201C;fatalistic,&#x201D; is the term the president prefers). Gordon is known for, among other things, a pithy and concise formula he developed to explain why President Obama, and many of his advisers, are so hesitant to engage fully in the various catastrophes of the Middle East. In Iraq, the Gordon dictum goes, Obama learned that full-scale invasions leading to regime change don&#x2019;t work; in Libya, he learned that partial interventions leading to regime collapse don&#x2019;t work; and in Syria he learned that non-intervention also doesn&#x2019;t work. An unspoken but obvious lesson: Once a president reaches this set of conclusions, can you blame him for wanting to pivot to Asia?</p>&#13;

        <div class="excerpt">
            <p>Donald Trump still has a chance to capture the Republican presidential nomination on the first ballot at the party&#x2019;s national convention this summer, thanks in part to his commanding victory in New York on Tuesday.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Unlike past GOP nominees, however, he might not have carte blanche to pick his running mate.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Delegates at the convention in Cleveland will vote separately on the nominations for president and vice president, and there is a key difference in the rules governing each vote: Although most of the delegates will be bound by their states to vote for a certain presidential candidate on the first ballot, none of them are required to vote for any candidate for vice president.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>That distinction opens up a Pandora&#x2019;s Box for Republicans, as they decide how to fill out their national ticket in November. It&#x2019;s possible, and even likely, that Trump will announce an agreeable, consensus pick for vice president, and in a vote for party unity, the delegates will ratify that choice.</p>&#13;

            <p>Three decades ago, the explosion of the Space Shuttle Challenger was one of the biggest stories of the year. But that year also saw hearings in the Iran-Contra affair, the re-opening of the Statue of Liberty after a long renovation, the fall of President Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines, and the crash of Aeromexico Flight 498 above Los Angeles. Photographers were also busy documenting the lives of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Joan Jett, Spike Lee, Halle Berry, Mike Tyson, and many others. Take a step into a visual time capsule now, for a brief look at the year 1986.</p>&#13;

        <div class="excerpt">
            <p dir="ltr">It is a myth that Americans cannot save. For decades, they did.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr">When personal-finance columnists explain America&#x2019;s poor saving habits, they sometimes start with the aspects of the human mind that make it challenging to plan for the future. Behavioral psychology is a useful scapegoat for many foibles. But the decline in savings is recent, and the human brain hasn&#x2019;t evolved since the Ford administration. The bottom 90 percent of households saved 10 percent of their income in the first Reagan administration. By 2006, their savings rate was nearly negative-10 percent.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr">Other writers suggest that the country&#x2019;s low saving rate is purely a matter of American exceptionalism. But it is also a myth that the U.S. is alone in its turn against saving in the last three decades. The personal savings rate has fallen <a href="https://www.kansascityfed.org/publicat/econrev/pdf/2q06garn.pdf">in Canada, Germany, and Japan</a>, as well.</p>&#13;

            <p>It&#x2019;s going to be Hillary Clinton&#x2019;s nomination. But it&#x2019;s not going to be her party. It looks likely to be her election&#x2014;but not so likely to be her government.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Tuesday&#x2019;s vote in New York brings closer a high-risk outcome in November. A Trump nomination in Cleveland means large-scale Republican no-shows at the polls. In 1972, Democrats repelled by their party choice split their tickets, re-electing both Richard Nixon and a Democratic Congress. Ticket-splitting has become rarer since then. Disappointed partisans now stay home, and voters who stay home spread defeat all the way down the ticket.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Hillary Clinton, so often described as a weak candidate, may yet pull a handsome slew of wins into Congress behind her.</p>&#13;
