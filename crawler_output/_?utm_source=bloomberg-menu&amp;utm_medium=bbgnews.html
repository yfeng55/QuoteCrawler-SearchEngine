Our guest is Paul Levy, who since 1988 has led JLL Partners, a New York leveraged buyout firm. Levy, who's had a ringside seat for private equity's explosive growth and evolution, talks about the highs and lows of his colorful career. Even as he slams the buyout world's obsession with short-term profits, he stoutly defends it against the accusation that it slashes jobs and strips value from companies.

But change has swept stock markets in recent years, diminishing their role in everyday trading. Now, the vast majority of stock trades take place through computerized systems, giving rise to huge debate over the dangers and benefits of high-frequency and automated trading.\n\nThis week, Pimm Fox, co-anchor of Taking Stock on Bloomberg Radio, joins Odd Lots co-host Tracy Alloway to speak with Keith Bliss, senior vice president at Cuttone & Co. and one of a dwindling number of floor traders left at the New York Stock Exchange. We visit a bygone era when 5,000 traders swaggered through the crowded floors of the NYSE -- unafraid to prank their bosses, or indeed, even the president of the United States.","url":"http://assets.bwbx.io/av/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/vXBpMtKARUsE/v4.mp3","publishedAt":1458574593},"_expanded":true}},"headline":"20: The Time NYSE Floor Traders Tried to Prank President Reagan","id":"O4EBCY6TTDSM01","metadata":{"social":{"twitterHandle":null}},"publishedAt":"2016-03-21T15:36:34.384Z","groupPublishedAt":"2016-03-21T15:36:34.384Z","quote":{},"slug":"2016-03-21/20-the-time-nyse-floor-traders-tried-to-prank-president-reagan","tags":{"labels":[],"topics":[],"tickers":[]},"type":"audio","updatedAt":"2016-03-21T15:36:34.384Z","url":"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2016-03-21/20-the-time-nyse-floor-traders-tried-to-prank-president-reagan","primarySite":"bbiz","revision":"O4EBCY6TTDSM","shortUrl":"http://bloom.bg/1UJfC7A","summary":"For years, the image of a stock market trader was synonymous with images of Testosterone-fueled traders wheeling and dealing on the floor of big exchanges.
